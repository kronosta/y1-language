Y1 is an unofficial .NET programming language focusing on ease of using the System.Reflection.Emit library.

# Purpose
I wanted to have a programming language that could both interop with C#, Visual Basic, F#, etc. and be used to dynamically generate code using System.Reflection.Emit, but without all of the overhead that C# has. Another goal was to make the syntax "interesting" (don't worry, it's not that different, it just doesn't follow a common syntax family like C, BASIC, or Lisp).
